# The-Collatz-Conjecture-Reduced-to-a-Single-Explicit-Finite-Verification-Problem-Ian-Adams-GPT-5.2
This repository presents a mathematically rigorous reduction of the Collatz conjecture, showing that the infinite problem over all integers is equivalent to the emptiness of one explicitly defined finite avoidance set. The work separates unconditional theory from a final finite verification step.
